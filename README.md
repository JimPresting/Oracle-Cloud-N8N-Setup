# Oracle-Cloud-N8N-Setup

Setting up an Oracle Cloud VM can be tricky due to Always-Free tier restrictions. By default, free-tier capacity is limited, so provisioning may fail unless you optimize your region choice or account type.

---

## Prerequisites

- A valid Oracle Cloud account at cloud.oracle.com  
- A remembered **Account Name** (password managers often omit this)  
- An SSH key-pair (public & private)  

---

## 1. Register & Optimize Your Account

1. **Sign up** at cloud.oracle.com  
   - Provide Account Name, Email, Password  
   - **Remember** the Account Name for future logins  

2. **Boost provisioning success**  
   - **Select the right region**  
     - Some regions (e.g. Chicago – US-Central) may throttle Always-Free VMs  
     - Choose a region with lighter demand (e.g. Frankfurt, Germany)  
   - **Optionally upgrade** to **Pay As You Go**  
     - Retains eligibility for Always-Free resources  
     - Improves chances of successful VM creation  

> **Note:** Region selection is permanent for that tenancy.

---

## 2. Create Your Always-Free VM

1. From the Oracle Cloud **Dashboard**, click **Create Instance**.  
2. Under **Shape**, choose an Always-Free configuration:  
   - **RM1** processor  
   - **4 OCPUs** (cores)  
   - **24 GB RAM**  
3. Leave **Boot Volume** and **Network** settings at default.  
4. **Generate & Download** your SSH key-pair:  
   - Keep the **private key** secure (e.g. in Downloads)  
   - Note the location of your **public key**

---

## 3. SSH Access

1. Locate your VM's **Public IPv4**:  
   - **Compute → Instances → Your Instance → Networking**  
   - Copy the Public IP  

   ![Networking Panel](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fce460e8-6b9a-4c83-9b4d-4c64e0d07a74)

2. From your local terminal, run:  
   ```bash
   ssh -i ~/Downloads/ssh-key-2025-04-29.key ubuntu@YOUR_PUBLIC_IP
   ```  
   - Replace the key path and IP as needed

---

## 4. Reserve a Static IP & Configure DNS

1. In Oracle Cloud, go to **Network → Virtual Cloud Networks → Public IPs**  
   - **Assign** a reserved (static) Public IPv4 to your instance  
   - For detailed instructions, watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IVG9hTwN_Q
   - If you already created an instance before, you can also later configure this by clicking on your Instance → Networking and then on your VNIC

2. In your domain registrar's **DNS settings**, add an **A-record**:  

| Host (subdomain)  | Type | Value (IPv4)         |
|-------------------|:----:|----------------------|
| `your-subdomain`  | A    | `<Your Static IPv4>` |

---

## 5. Open HTTP/HTTPS in Oracle Cloud Security Lists

1. In the Oracle Cloud Console, navigate to **Networking → Virtual Cloud Networks**.  
2. Select the VCN associated with your project (only one if new account).  
3. Click **Security** in the left sidebar, then choose the **Default Security List** for that VCN.  
4. Switch to the **Security Rules** tab, then click **Add Ingress Rules**.  
5. Add these rules:  

| Source CIDR   | IP Protocol | Port Range | Description         |
|-------------: |------------:|-----------:|---------------------|
| `0.0.0.0/0`   | TCP         | `80`       | Allow HTTP traffic  |
| `0.0.0.0/0`   | TCP         | `443`      | Allow HTTPS traffic |

6. Click **Save**.
7. Note: You can add all sorts of ports here. If you install PostgreSQL or Redis, you just need to add the appropriate port, and it will work.

---

## 6. ⚠️ CRITICAL: Configure Ubuntu iptables Firewall ⚠️

> **THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT STEP FOR ORACLE CLOUD!**  
> Even with Oracle Security Lists configured, the Ubuntu instance has its own iptables firewall that blocks ports 80/443 by default. Without this step, Certbot will fail and your n8n instance won't be accessible!

SSH into your instance and run these commands:

```bash
# Add rules to allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic
sudo iptables -I INPUT 4 -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -I INPUT 5 -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT

# Install iptables-persistent to save rules permanently
sudo apt-get install iptables-persistent -y

# Save the current iptables rules
sudo netfilter-persistent save
```

To verify the rules are added:
```bash
sudo iptables -L INPUT -n -v --line-numbers
```

You should see the rules for ports 80 and 443 in the list.

> **Note:** This is the KEY DIFFERENCE between Oracle Cloud and GCP. GCP doesn't have this local firewall issue, but Oracle Ubuntu instances do!

---

## 7. Install n8n

From here, the installation process is identical to the GCP guide:

🔗 **[Continue with the n8n on GCP guide from Step 3 »](https://github.com/JimPresting/n8n-gcp-selfhost#step-3-setting-up-n8n)**

The remaining steps include:
- Installing Docker
- Setting up n8n with Docker
- Installing and configuring Nginx
- Setting up SSL with Certbot
- Creating auto-update scripts and cronjobs

All commands and configurations from the GCP guide work exactly the same on Oracle Cloud once you've completed the iptables configuration above.

---

## Summary

The main differences between Oracle Cloud and GCP setup are:
1. **Oracle Security Lists** instead of GCP Firewall rules
2. **Ubuntu iptables firewall** must be configured (Step 6) - this is CRITICAL!
3. Different SSH username (`ubuntu` for Oracle vs your Google account name for GCP)

Once these Oracle-specific steps are complete, follow the GCP guide for all n8n installation and configuration steps.
